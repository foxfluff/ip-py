  TODO:
  - Implement an inverse function (probably using ~) that is effectively
    Ipv4(addr) ^ Ipv4('255.255.255.255')
  - Define some useful predefined addresses like a loopback address or global
    broadcast
  - Document Ipv4
  - Still have to do pretty much everything for Ipv6
  - At some point have some sort of built in function to tunnel Ipv4 over Ipv6?

 - Added support for IPv4 address assignment and retrieval
 - Added test.py, allowing for easier debugging in the future
 - Moved ip.py, ipv4.py, ipv6.py, and __init.py__ to the ip directory for
   proper package usage
 - Fixed bugs with new IPv4 initialization, now supports int/long to accomodate
   for math operators which return int/long
 - Fixed bugs with operators in Ip and Ipv4 where objects returned were builtin
   types instead of Ip or Ipv4 respectively
 - Fixed bugs with implementation of Ipv4 bitwise operators when being passed
   another Ipv4 instance
 - Fixed naming issue with indexing function (used __index__ instead of
   __getitem__)

 - Minor addition to accomodate for arithmetic operations, have not been tested
   due to the lack of address handing

 - Completely restructured the project, removed old code, rewriting code for
   the new infrastructure.
